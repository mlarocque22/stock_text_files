# stock_text_files
All of the text files for the different screens I have created


I am storing all of the different .txt files that my various screning programs have created in order to more easily access them


NYSE.txt is a list of every stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with their ticker

Portfolio_update_total.txt is the most current returns on the portfolio created from my Stock_Screener program

The rest are self explanitory
