# stock_text_files
All of the text files for the different screens I have created


I am storing all of the different .txt files that my various screning programs have created in order to more easily access them


NYSE.txt is a list of every stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with their ticker

Portfolio_update_total.txt is the most current returns on the portfolio created from my Stock_Screener program

Inside the Indsustry folder there are 3 types of text files. 

Ones that says Industry_$'Price' is an alphabetical list of stocks under a price threshold that support options and include their industry and sector

Ones that say Sorted_Sector_$'Price' is a sorted list of stocks under a price threshold sorted by their more generalized sector

Ones that say Sorted_Specific_$'Price' are a sorted list of stocks under a price threshold sorted by their more specific industry

The rest are self explanitory
