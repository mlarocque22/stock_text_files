# stock_text_files
All of the text files for the different screens I have created


I am storing all of the different .txt files that my various screning programs have created in order to more easily access them. I added a NASDAQ option for my different programs so each folder now has both a NYSE and NASDAQ option.


NYSE.txt is a list of every stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with their ticker.

NASDAQ.txt is a list of every stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange, with their ticker.

Portfolio_update_total.txt is the most current returns on the portfolio created from my Stock_Screener program

Inside the Penny_Stocks folder there are multiple text files which just show every NYSE stock under a set price threshold

Inside the Penny_Options folder there a multiple text files which just show every stock on the NYSE under a set price threshold that also support options

Inside the Indsustry folder there are 3 types of text files:

Ones that says Industry_$'Price' is an alphabetical list of stocks under a price threshold that support options and include their industry and sector
 
Ones that say Sorted_Sector_$'Price' is a sorted list of stocks under a price threshold sorted by their more generalized sector

Ones that say Sorted_Specific_$'Price' are a sorted list of stocks under a price threshold sorted by their more specific industry

The rest are self explanitory
